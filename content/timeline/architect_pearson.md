Gustav Hjalmer Persson was born in Norrkopping Sweden on 20 March 1879,
the youngest of 3 children of Gustav and Amanda Persson. The family
emigrated to the United States in 1882, settling in Chicago. Like many
Scandinavian immigrants to the United States in the 19th century, he anglicized
his name, becoming George Elmer Pearson.

We haven't yet found where Pearson trained as an architect. In the early 20th
century, there were essentially two ways that someone could become a licensed
architect: either through formal schooling at a college or university or through
apprenticeship to an established architect. It appears that Pearson followed the
second path. The 1900 census shows Pearson was working as a carpenter. In
the 1910 census, he was employed as a clerk in an architect’s office.
Unfortunately, there is no record of who that architect was.

In March 1919, Pearson ran the following advertisement in several building
trade journals in the Chicago area:

> “Mr. G. E. Pearson, architect, recently returned from war service, has opened an office at 1930 N. Keystone Avenue, Chicago.”

This marked the beginning of a prolific career. Over the next two decades,
Pearson would be responsible for countless buildings in the Chicago area. In
Oak Park alone, there are more than 225 and perhaps as many as 275 homes
and apartment buildings from designs by Pearson. Like many architects,
Pearson would design a house and then license a contractor to build a certain
number of houses from that plan, as well as variations of it.

The above is a quote from the "Dull Thesis".
