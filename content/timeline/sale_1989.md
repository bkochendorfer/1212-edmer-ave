House was purchased from Ruth Peterson, relative of original owner Peter Peterson. During this renovation the attic was expanded to include an additional two bedrooms and bathroom.

The home was purchased by Suzanne Greene. Greene lived in the home until 2021 and performed several renovations to the property during this time. More information to come!
