## Building Permits

![Oak Leaves](/images/oak-leaves-1927.jpg)

In the January 8th edition of [Oak Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Press) there are three building permits issued to the contractors Ellefson & Bentsen. The addresses are 1216, 1212, and 1206 Edmer Ave. It is believed they built from one set of plans and slightly modified the plan based on the orientation of the home and the lot size.

The valuation in 1927 is $12,000
